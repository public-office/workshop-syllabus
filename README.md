### Course Outline
This course will begin by looking into the roots of network culture in an effort to understand what the fundamentals of what a website is and how it functions both oline and offline. By utilising what you have learned about composition, typography, and hierarchy as a basis, we will draw the comparisons between the contemporary tools used for offline design and the modern web browser. We will examine and critique the current state of the post-capitalist internet, its conservative structures and aesthetics... 

You will begin by learning how to navigate your machine with the terminal, build a simple structure and deploy your first code to Github.
