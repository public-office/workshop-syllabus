### Course Outline
This course will begin by looking at your machine, as system and framework in an effort to understand what the fundamentals of what a website is and how it functions both online and offline. By utilising your knowledge about composition, typography, and hierarchy as a basis – we will draw comparisons between the contemporary tools and the modern web browser as a space for design.

## Setup Instructions

### Terminal

Your Mac includes a console application called Terminal.app, located in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`. The easiest way to open Terminal.app is to use the Spotlight shortcut <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> and then type "Terminal".

Once your terminal is open you can add it to your Dock for quick access.

The terminal accepts a form of computer code at the prompt called `bash`, and is used to interact with the various functions of your computer.

### git

`git` should be already installed on your Mac and almost ready to go. However when you first run `git` the XCode Developer Tools will need to be installed.

In your terminal, enter the following command to start the process if necessary.

```
git --version
```

Next tell git to only ask for your password once and remember it.

```
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

Tell git your name and email address.

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

```
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

### GitHub

GitHub is an online platform for hosting code and providing tools for publication and collaboration with other developers. Your `git` command line tool will "push" and "pull" code from GitHub.

Visit [GitHub](https://github.com) and create an account. Use the name email address you entered into your git config. Remember your username and password.

Your username will form part of your website addresses, ie `https://public-office.github.io/workshop-syllabus`

### Text editor

Computer code is text. When writing code you will use a plain text editor. Any text editor can work, however there are speciailised text editors that are designed for writing code, offering useful features such as syntax highlighting, code hints/completion and file management.

Download and install one of the following code editors:

  * [Atom](https://atom.io/)<sup>*</sup>
  * [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

\* We assume you will choose Atom as your editor during the course.

### Web browser

In this course we will use Google Chrome as our web browser. If you haven't already, download and install Chrome [here](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
