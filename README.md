### Workshop Syllabus
12.–26.08.2018 RMIT University<br>
Masters of Communication Design<br>
Mondays, Studio 09.

### Course Outline
This course will begin by looking into the roots of network culture in an effort to understand what the fundamentals of what a website is and how it functions both oline and offline. By utilising what you have learned about composition, typography, and hierarchy as a basis, we will draw the comparisons between the contemporary tools used for offline design and the modern web browser. We will examine and critique the current state of the post-capitalist internet, its conservative structures and aesthetics... 

You will begin by learning how to navigate your machine with the terminal, build a simple structure and deploy your first code to Github.

## Setup Instructions

### Terminal

Your Mac includes a console application called Terminal.app, located in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`. The easiest way to open Terminal.app is to use the Spotlight shortcut <kbd>⌘</kbd>-<kbd>Space</kbd> and then type "Terminal".

Once your terminal is open you can add it to your Dock for quick access.

### git

`git` should be already installed on your mac, but needs to be updated and XCode developer tools need to be installed.
Run `git --version` in your terminal to start the process.

Next, Configure git credentials
```
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```
