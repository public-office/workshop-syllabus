### Workshop Syllabus
12.–26.08.2018 RMIT University<br>
Masters of Communication Design<br>
Mondays, Studio 09.

### Course Outline
This course will begin by looking into the roots of network culture in an effort to understand what the fundamentals of what a website is and how it functions both oline and offline. By utilising what you have learned about composition, typography, and hierarchy as a basis, we will draw the comparisons between the contemporary tools used for offline design and the modern web browser. We will examine and critique the current state of the post-capitalist internet, its conservative structures and aesthetics... 

You will begin by learning how to navigate your machine with the terminal, build a simple structure and deploy your first code to Github.

## Setup Instructions

### Terminal

Your Mac includes a console application called Terminal.app, located in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`. The easiest way to open Terminal.app is to use the Spotlight shortcut <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> and then type "Terminal".

Once your terminal is open you can add it to your Dock for quick access.

### git

`git` should be already installed on your Mac and almost ready to go. However when you first run `git` the XCode Developer Tools will need to be installed.

In your terminal, run
```
git --version
```
to start the process if necessary.

Next, Configure git credentials
```
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

### GitHub

GitHub is an online platform for hosting code and providing tools for publication and collaboration with other developers. Your `git` command line tool will "push" and "pull" code from GitHub.

Visit [GitHub](https://github.com) and create an account.
Remember your username and password.
Your username will form part of your website addresses, ie `https://public-office.github.io/workshop-syllabus`

### Text editor

Install a text editor

  * [Atom](https://atom.io/)<sup>*</sup>
  * [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
  * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

\* As **code is text**, you can use any plain text editor to write it. However we assume you will use Atom as your editor and will use it during the course.
