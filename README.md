### Course Outline
This course will begin by looking into the roots of network culture in an effort to understand what the essence of a website is. You will begin by learning how to navigate your machine with the terminal, build a simple framework and deploy your first code to Github. 

This course has a formal emphasis, utilising what knowledge students have about composition, typography, and hierarchy as a basis. We will understand interaction as a prompt and feedback, an input and output, a call and response. We will examine their relation but also not limit an interaction to a closed, hermetic environment, but view the web as a very social ecosystem in which time and performance play important roles.
